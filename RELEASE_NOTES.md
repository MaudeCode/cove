## 🤖 Agents Management

A complete redesign of the Workspace page into a full-featured Agents view:

- **Overview tab** — See agent identity, avatar, workspace path, and model at a glance
- **Files tab** — Browse and edit workspace files (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, etc.) with token counts
- **Tools tab** — Configure tool access with profile presets and per-tool toggles
- **Skills tab** — Enable/disable skills per-agent with allowlist management
- **CRUD support** — Create new agents, update settings, or delete agents directly from the UI

## 💭 Thinking Blocks

Extended thinking is now visible in chat history as collapsible blocks:

- **Collapsed by default** — Keep the chat clean while preserving thinking context
- **Click to expand** — Review the model's reasoning process when needed
- **Token summary** — See thinking token count without expanding

## 📊 Compaction Indicator

Visual feedback when context overflow triggers compaction:

- **Inline divider** — Shows exactly where old messages were summarized
- **Subtle styling** — Doesn't disrupt reading flow
- **Anchored position** — Stays in place even when new messages arrive
