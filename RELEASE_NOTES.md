## ⏰ Cron Job Editor Improvements

The cron job editor gets a major usability upgrade:

- **Fullscreen payload editor** — Edit complex payloads with a proper code editor, not cramped inline fields
- **Timezone autocomplete** — Fuzzy search through timezones instead of typing IANA identifiers from memory
- **Stagger support** — Configure job stagger settings directly in the UI

---

## 🔤 Code Font Selection

Customize the monospace font used for code blocks and the editor:

- **Multiple font options** — JetBrains Mono, Source Code Pro, OpenDyslexic, and system default
- **Instant preview** — Changes apply immediately across all code in the UI
- **Persisted preference** — Your choice syncs with other Cove settings

## 👁️ Better Context Visibility

See what the model actually sees in long conversations:

- **History truncation indicator** — Shows when older messages were dropped to fit context
- **Omitted image placeholders** — Clear markers when images were excluded from context
