# 🦞 Cove

A cozy WebUI for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) chat.

Built with [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Philosophy

**Keep it minimal.** Resist the urge to add dependencies. Preact is chosen specifically because it's tiny (~3KB). Every addition should be justified.

## Features

- 💬 Clean chat interface
- 🌙 Light/dark mode (follows system preference)
- 📱 Responsive design

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

npm run dev

# Build for production

npm run preview
```
